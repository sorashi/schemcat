One of them is a design of a multi-model application, where the step from the conceptual layer to a set of distinct interlinked logical models is not straightforward. We propose an approach based on category theory, which provides a unified view of the data and a solid mathematical basis for their management. We propose a schema and instance categories covering popular models and we show how an ER model can be transformed to such a categorical layer. We also outline the whole framework based on the categorical model.},
