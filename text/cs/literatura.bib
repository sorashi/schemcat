Some implications for data integrity, information retrieval, and data manipulation are discussed.             The entity-relationship model can be used as a basis for unification of different views of data: the network model, the relational model, and the entity set model.

Focusing on promising features and taking into account mature and verified principles, we overview the key parts of the framework and outline open questions and research directions that need to be further investigated. The ultimate objective is to pursue the idea of a self-tuning system that would permit us to collapse the traditionally understood conceptual and logical layers into just a single model allowing for unified handling of schemas, data instances, as well as queries.},

However, the step from a conceptual (e.g., ER or UML) schema to a logical multi-model schema of a particular database, as well as its further correct maintenance, is not simple and straightforward.In this paper, we introduce MM-cat, a modular and extensible framework that enables to perform all the necessary steps to design a multi-model schema. An initial ER schema is transformed to a unified categorical representation which can then be easily mapped to any combination of models in a particular DBMS, or their set. In addition, MM-cat also provides a categorical representation of multi-model data instances to be processed uniformly. Both the schema and instance categories serve as the core for further management of multi-model data. The whole process of transformation to/from the categorical representation is demonstrated using MongoDB and PostgreSQL.},

  abstract = {As most of the DBMSs have become multi-model, there have occurred plenty of related issues. One of them is a design of a multi-model application, where the step from the conceptual layer to a set of distinct interlinked logical models is not straightforward. We propose an approach based on category theory, which provides a unified view of the data and a solid mathematical basis for their management. We propose a schema and instance categories covering popular models and we show how an ER model can be transformed to such a categorical layer. We also outline the whole framework based on the categorical model.},
