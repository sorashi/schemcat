This thesis concerns development of a graphical application for conceptual modeling of database schemas without prior knowledge of the target database paradigm.
This is achieved by exploiting schema categories, that are a generalization of previously known models such as ER and UML.
These models can be converted into schematic categories and the resulting application will enable this functionality.
The traditional procedure for creating a database schema is first the design of a conceptual model using e.g. ER, which is then converted into the logical layer, traditionally the relational model, which is in turn applied in relational databases.
Many novel database models are available these days and the resources of ER and UML are often not sufficient to describe them.
The resulting application will offer the option to model in the familiar ER schema, automatic conversion to a schematic category, and the option to edit or model the schematic category directly.
