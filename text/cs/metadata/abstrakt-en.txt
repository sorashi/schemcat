This thesis concerns the development of a graphical application for conceptual modeling of database schemas without prior knowledge of the target database paradigm.
The purpose of a conceptual model is to allow describing the abstract structure of data independently of their physical storage.
These days, a lot of different logical data models are used in database systems.
The expression capabilities of well-known conceptual models like ER or UML are sometimes insufficient for describing the structure of data for target logical models.
For this reason, we will exploit a recent concept called schema categories, which is more general, has a higher power of expression, and unifies data modeling for different database systems, including multi-model ones.
Furthermore, schema categories blur the line between the conceptual and logical layers of data modeling.
The resulting graphical web application will allow modeling schemas of the well-known ER model and their automatic conversion into schema categories with a user-friendly visualization.
